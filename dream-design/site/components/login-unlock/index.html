<p class="lead">Youtube, the largest video search engine in the internet, receives new design ideas.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

  <blockquote>
  YouTube’s Home Page and Video Page have been changed time and time again throughout the years. The following sections outlines the changes in the YouTube pages which could improve the five different metrics: learnability, efficiency, errors, memorability, and satisfaction. 
</blockquote>

  <blockquote> These sections include changing the Home Page. In the first section of the new design, several features will be added to the Home Page that may improve it overall. The second section will describe the changes in the Video Page, the page where people watch videos after being clicked on. By changing the page, the videos may become easier to watch or have features that help improve the users’ experience.  </blockquote>

<h3> YouTube Pages </h3>
  <p> The current setup of YouTube are shown below. </p>

    <h3>New Design</h3>
      <h4> <b>Home Page Changes:</b></h4>
        <h5><b> Extra Features to the Top of Page:</b></h5>
        <h5> An additional design for the top of the Home Page would be adding the navigation bar between the search bar and section of videos. The new navigation would include the latest and most popular videos of news, sports, gaming, etc all of which are already found on the left-hand side of the website. This would free up space below for more videos of a person’s favorite channels or subscribed channels. In addition, this would allow more features on the left which will be discussed later on. </h5>
     <b></b>
      <h4><b>Metrics: </b></h4> 
       <h5>By adding extra topics to the navigation bar, users will have an easier time identifying how to get to specific videos of the topics of their choice, increasing efficiency and satisfaction. The navigation is in plain view so it is easy to find. People will then remember where to look, improving the memorability of the function. Errors and learnability are expected to stay the same. </h5>

    <h3>YouTube Video Page</h3>

     <h3>New Design</h3>
        <h4> <b>Home Page Changes:</b></h4>
          <h5><b> Extra Features to the Top of Page:</b></h5>
            <h5> An additional design for the top of the Video Page would be the ability to play two videos at once with the secondary video in one-twentieth of the  size playing in the top right corner of the primary video. The user would be able to seamlessly go between the two videos by clicking the video on the top right and the two videos would then switch positions. The user would be able to do this by right clicking on the video and finding the new option of “Corner Video” which sends their video to the right corner of the video already playing. If there is no video then the option will be disabled. The secondary video would change in the size depending on what zoom the user is in.</h5>
      <b></b>
        <h4><b>Metrics: </b></h4> 
          <h5>By adding the secondary video to the corner, users can seamlessly change from one or the other. The efficiency of the user will increase since they do not need to exit the video to change but just have it open in the corner. In addition, the satisfaction will go up as well due to the increase in the efficiency. There may be an increase in errors since the users may accidently pause the current video when switching between the two. The function would be memorable enough for most people to have an easier time getting their videos. </h5>

<h3> Overall Changes </h3>
  <h4> Recent History Tab</h4> 
    <blockquote> Currently, YouTube provides a history tab when an account is accessed. This shows the history of the user up to a certain point. However, this only works for a user who is logged in to their own account which can be inconveniant for a user not on their own account or does not have one.
      <p> </p>
      The new design that is being proposed is for the recent history bar being accessible for all users, logged and unlogged in. The bar would be located in place of where the topic sections for Sports, Gaming, etc. was located earlier. The user could access this by simply pressing the Recent History tab which will show a dropdown of all the vidoes accessed within a couple of days. Each video will be the same as YouTube currently structures it. </blockquote> 
      <h5><b>Metrics: </b></h5> 
        <h5>In comparison to how YouTube's original History systme works, the new system eliminates the extra step of having to navigate to a new webpage and provides an organized list based on date accessed of the videos. By eliminating the extra step, user would become more efficient when searching for old videos. The amount of errors are expected to go down since the history will be in plain view and accessible. The learnability and memorability of the new design should be the same as YouTube's old design since it is extremely similiar to where the old Recent History button was located.</h5>
  <h4> Voice Commands</h4> 
    <blockquote> By supporting voice functions, YouTube will become more accessible to those with certain disabilities. Vidoes will become quicker to access and more hands free. 
      <p> </p>
      With voice commands, a user does not need to be next to a computer but can access videos without ever needing to move. In doing so, vidoes can be found faster by using the search.list in the YouTube API. </blockquote> 
      <h5><b>Metrics: </b></h5> 
        <h5> Voice commands have been around for many years. With voice commands, similiar to smart phones, the user can have a hands-free interaction, becoming more efficient and is able to learn the commands easily. Voice commands are already prevalent in today's society, so the learnbility of voice commands should be a simple transition to the new design. There may be some errors due to voice recognition itself but the satisfaction should increase since it becomes relatively easy to use the voice commands. Lastly, the memorability should be better since the voice commands can have simple commands such as "Search X" or "Play Video". </h5>
  <h4> Mouse Hovering</h4> 
    <blockquote> Youtube videos all provide a thumbnail that encompasses what the video would be about. However, some of these thumbnails do not provide an accurate representation of the video which could waste users' time. 
      <p> </p>
      With mouse hovering, videos will show a thirty second preview of the video when moused over. After the thirty seconds are over the user has the option of continuing the video. If the mouse is taken off the thumbnail then the video will pause. 
      </blockquote> 
      <h5><b>Metrics: </b></h5> 
        <h5>By adding mouse hovering, users are less likely to make errors in watching videos since they could watch a thirty second segment which could inform them whether the video they were looking at was the right one. Mousing over a thumbnail is easy to learn and memorable since it has been around multiple websites as is. Lastly, the efficiency of the video may drop since the user hould have to use thirty seconds extra to check the video but the drastic decrease in errors outweighs the slight. downfall.</h5>

<h3> Usage <h3>
  <blockquote>Old Home Page Usage: </blockquote>
    <h4> When entering the home page of YouTube, users would check the recommended videos and then likely proceed to check their subscriptions (reference picture from YouTube Home Page). If they saw any new videos that interested them, the user would click on the title or thumbnail and would be sent to that video. A specific subject such as politics, sports, news, etc. that might interest the user would be located on the left side and the user could access that by clicking on the subject they're interested in. The user may be interested in looking for a recent video they watched so they would have to find the Recent History link and click on it before going to a new webpage with the their video history. Lastly, if the user did not have any videos that interested them, they would look up the search term in the search bar.</h4>
  <blockquote> New Home Page Usage: </blockquote>
    <h4> The changes that are implemented in the Home Page are adding a larger navigation bar, a recent history section, mouse hovering over vidoes, and voice commands. The user enters the home page and immediately sees the navigation bar for YouTube. Instead of having to search the left side of the screen, the user can easily click the title of the subject they're interested in which would then show the most popular vidoes of that subject, instead of having to go to a completely different webpage. Also, if the users were interested in continuing a clsoed video, they look to the left side of the screen and check the date of the video. After finding the date, the user clicks on the video and is taken to where they left off.
    <br> </br> 
    <h4>At the home page, a user may become fascinated in a recommended video. By mousing over it, a pop-up would appear showing a thirty-second clip. If the user realized that the video wasn't correct they would close the screen, or if it did interest them, they would press on the video which would take them to the webpage of the video playing.</h4>
    <br> </br>
    Lastly, if the user was away from their computer or already had a video in mind. The user could simply say "Search (Video Title)". The voice commands will then show a list of videos that matched the search term which the user would then use to play a video.
    <br> </br>
    <blockquote>Old Video Page Usage: </blockquote>
    <h4> When playing a video, users would only be able to watch one video in full screen. To go to another video, they must exit out of the full screen and check the right side for the list of videos that were similiar to the one they were watching. They would then click on one by the thumbnail or title or search for a new list of videos. Lastly, they would have to go to a different webpage if the user wanted to to rewatch an older video they had already watched.</h4>
<h3> Variants </h3> 
  <blockquote> For Windows 7, some computer have the option for a fingerprint scanner. A fingerprint scanner allows the user to suplement their fingerprint as a password by swiping their selected finger onto the scanner. As such, both the fingerprint and password for each user can be used to unlock the computer. <br> </br>
  OS X does not have this feature. Also, across all platforms and websites, the same steps are taken except that some websites require a security question to login.<br> </br>
  A picture of the scanner can be found below.</blockquote>

<h3> Key Characteristics <h3>
  <blockquote> The Unlock/Login screen allows selection and provides an easy, spaced out layout for the different domains. It becomes easy to navigate and zooms in when a domain is selected. At the Unlock window, it provides examples and intuitive instructions. 
    <br> </br>
    Windows 7's design uses colors effectively by invoking the pleasing aeshtic of their backgrounds, following their guidelines. It provides easy to read icons that make using the Login/Unlock screen easy to navigate.
    <br> </br>
    OS X's design follows uses clear and precise languge as well as clear UI content so the screen isn't cluttered or hard to follow. The guidelines are specifically followed by making the interface the main point instead of aesthetic.</blockquote>
    <h3> Feedback <h3> 
    <blockquote>When the button is pressed, it provides feedback by comprehensively showing that the computer is being unlocked by taking away the unlock screen. It replaces the screen with a different screen and unlocks the computer if its works otherwise it will return to the unlock screen.</blockquote>
<h3> Summary of History of Control Alt Delete </h3>
<blockquote> David Bradley helped build IBM’s new personal computer. Yet, when the computer encountered a glitch, then they had to manually restart the system. So Bradley created a keyboard shortcut ctrl + alt + del that triggered a system reset.<br> </br>
The reason why those three keys were chosen was due to their placement since it wasn’t likely for all three keys to be pressed at the same time on accident. <br> </br>
 Although Bradley had created the shortcut to save time and help his fellow programmers, it was never intended for the customers. However, it wasn’t until much later on that Bradley’s shortcut became well-known. </blockquote>
